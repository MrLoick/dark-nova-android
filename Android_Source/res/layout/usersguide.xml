You worked on your family's farm, dreaming about a life as an intergalactic trader. You imagined yourself buying goods on one system, selling them on another making huge profits, battling pirates, finding opportunities and perhaps, one day even buy your own moon to which you could retire to live a wealthy and peaceful life for the rest of your days.

After your parents died, as their only child you inherited the farm. Since it would be too difficult to run it all on your own, you saw your chance clear and sold it to a neighbor. With the earnings, you bought a second-hand space ship of the Firefly type, equipped it with one pulse laser, and went to the local UGF space port to buy trade goods with your last 2500 credits. This is where your life as a space trader begins.

 <TextView android:text="space trader is to earn enough money so you can buy your own moon, then claim that moon and retire to it. You need a lot of money for that and will encounter many dangers. So along the way you might want to buy better ships and better equipment.

At first, the main point is to stay alive and earn some money by trading. The UGF has a space port in every solar system where goods locally produced are sold and goods the locals need are bought. A good trader will judge based on the systems tech level, government type, resources and current situation; which goods are cheap and which are expensive in a system and will adapt his trading strategy accordingly.

Later on when you are better equipped, you might try your hand at transporting passengers to other systems or perhaps become a bounty hunter alongside your trading job. If you feel so inclined, you might also become a pirate and rob other traders of their goods. Being a pirate can be very profitable, but remember that the police will try to hunt you down, and that as a pirate, you cannot sell goods out in the open (even those that you bought legally). You need an intermediary to sell your goods and this sleazy person will take 10% of everything your cargo sells for. This makes the return to an honest life all the more difficult.

As long as you have empty cargo bays, cash and the space port has affordable goods available, you can buy goods. Before you choose what you are going to buy however, it is best to consider which system you are going to sell them to. The Short Range Chart in your ship will show which systems are within range. Before you examine the Short Range Chart make sure you get a full tank of fuel at the Ship Yard. This will make it easier for you to find out which systems you can travel to. While you are at the Ship Yard, you can make hull repairs if required.

The Short Range Chart is connected to the UGFIN (United Galactic Federation Intergalactic Network) which can tell you many things about each local system. Most important to decide which system you select as your next target is the Average Price List of that system. This shows you which goods might be expected to earn you a profit. Note: there is no guarantee that you will actually get the price shown in the list. It doesn't take into account special resources and special situations of the target system. In addition, prices always fluctuate a bit.

Another important factor is how many pirates you might expect en route to your selected system. Especially early in your career you might wish to avoid systems which are heavily infested with pirates. The same holds true for the police when you are trafficking illegal goods.

When you know which system you want to travel to purchase the appropriate cargo and hyper warp away. To boost your purchasing power, apply for a loan at the bank. Depending on your police record and your current worth, the bank will probably be willing to help you out. Note: 10% interest must be paid daily, which will be automatically deducted from your cash balance when you jump to a new planet.

Your first ship, of the Firefly type, is mainly used for trading since it is rather weak and has limited defensive capabilities. You won't win any battles with it, since it has no weapon slot. However, once you buy a shield you will be able to transport passengers. As you gain experience you should buy a ship better suited to your needs.

Ships differ in their hull strengths, number of cargo bays, number of weapon slots, number of shield slots, number of gadget slots, number of crew quarters and maximum traveling range. At the Ship Yard they will inform you about the capabilities of each ship.

When you decide to buy a new ship you trade in your old one, including all of its equipment. The worth of your ship, including its cargo and equipment, is subtracted from the price of the new ship. You should be warned that if you have cargo on board which the people in the current system don't want, you will lose that cargo without any compensation. You should therefore sell a ship with empty cargo bays. You can not purchase a new ship if your current ship is transporting passengers, If you have an escape pod installed on your old ship it will be transferred to your new ship. Any insurance you have will be transferred along with your no-claim%.

<TextView android:text="your ship is divided in three groups. The first group consists of weapons and you can select one of three types of lasers for each available weapon slot. The more expensive the laser the more power it has. The second group consists of shields and you can choose from one of two shields for each available shield slot. The more expensive the shield is the better the protection it gives. The last group consists of gadgets which enhance certain functions of a ship.

The most important part of a spaceship is its hull. If the hull strength is reduced to zero percent during a fight, the ship will explode killing everyone on it and destroying everything it was carrying. You might fly your ship with a low hull strength, but UGF guidelines strongly suggest to never hyper warp unless your hull is at full strength. Repairs can be made at the Ship Yard of every system and they are fairly cheap, especially for the smaller ship types. The only way to survive the destruction of your ship is to have an escape pod installed, which will eject you automatically when your ship can't be saved anymore.

•Weapons
There are three types of lasers: pulse lasers, beam lasers and military lasers. The tech level of a system determines whether and which lasers are sold there. Military lasers are the best, but also the most expensive. If you have more than one weapon slot on your ship, it is probably wise to first fill them all before you start to buy better lasers. Two pulse lasers often do more damage than one beam laser and are cheaper overall. If you have no weapon slots on your ship, or have bought no weapons, you won't be able to attack.

•Shields
There are two types of shields: energy shields and reflection shields. The tech level of a system determines whether and which shields are sold there. Reflective shields are the best. Shields protect your hull from damage. When you are attacked, first your shields are depleted and only after they have been reduced to zero percent, your hull is damaged. During your travels, your shields are automatically recharging and while you are docked at a space port they always recharge to 100%.

•Gadgets
There are five types of gadgets available. The tech level of a system determines whether and which gadgets are sold there. For a beginning trader, the most interesting gadget is probably 5 extra cargo bays. These are fairly cheap and allow you to carry more cargo, so you probably earn them back quickly. If there is more than one gadget slot on your ship, you can even install more than one of this gadget, increasing your cargo bays even more. A navigating system helps you piloting your ship. An auto-repair system helps your engineering functions. A targeting system helps you handle your weaponry. A cloaking device is perhaps the most interesting gadget a trader can buy. It is very expensive, but it allows you to travel through space undetected, as long as you don't attack. However, a good engineer might detect a cloaked ship by its warp signature. The only way to avoid being detected is to employ your own engineering skills to fluctuate your warp signature. If a ship you pass has a better engineer than your own ship, you can't expect to stay undetected, though. But even if you are detected, your cloaking device is useful, since it makes you more difficult to hit and you can escape more easily.

•Escape Pod
An escape pod can be bought at the Ship Yard. If you have one installed, when your ship gets destroyed it is activated automatically and ejects your crew and yourself. The UGF space rescue will pick you up in a few days time and drop you off at a nearby system. There you can convert the pod to a ship and continue your journey, though your original ship and cargo will be lost.

•Insurance
If you have an escape pod installed, you can buy insurance for your ship (available at every bank). If you have insurance the bank will refund your ship's trade-in value in the case of an escape pod ejection. You have to pay a daily rate, which depends on the worth of your ship for the insurance. This rate will drop 1% for every day you don't claim, up to a reduction of 90%. Since the no-claim gets transferred to a new ship when you buy one, it may be useful to rack up your no-claim days with a cheap ship, before you buy an expensive one. Note that after an ejection, you have to buy a new escape pod and thus new insurance. Your no-claim will be reset to 0%.

•Warping to another system. As soon as you have left the space port area, you activate your warp engine. The warp engine creates a hyperspace bubble around your ship and you get transported to your target system instantly. This is what actually consumes the fuel. You materialize at a safe distance from the target system's space port, usually about 20 clicks.
•Approaching the target space port. The last few clicks en route to the target space port are the most dangerous of your journey. You may and very probably will encounter other ships, among which there may be fellow traders, police ships and pirates. Fellow traders won't attack unless provoked. The police might ask you to submit to an inspection, of which an honest trader, who doesn't deal in illegal goods (firearms and narcotics), has nothing to fear. Pirates will often attack you on sight.
•Docking at the target space port.When you have reached the target space port, you are safe from interventions by other ships and you can dock at your leisure after you have asked permission of the control tower.

A few solar systems are fortunate enough to have a wormhole nearby. A wormhole is a rift in space-time, which leads directly from one place in the galaxy to another. You can use the wormhole to travel to another system in an instant, even if that other system is at the other end of the galaxy. You can only enter a wormhole from the space port of the system that owns it. That system will tax you for the use of the wormhole. The tax depends on your ship type: poor traders with a small ship pay considerably less than rich traders with a huge ship. On the plus side: you won't spend any fuel traveling through a wormhole, which compensates partly for the tax. When you zoom in on a planet from the short range chart, you can easily tell if there is worm hole travel available as you cycle through the available systems; the button will change from green to red and clearly state WORM HOLE.

<TextView android:text="to a trader. You will probably excel in one or two skills and lack in the others. However, you can compensate for that by hiring mercenaries. Mercenaries have skills just like you and if a mercenary is, for instance, a better pilot than you are, he or she will take over your piloting duties when needed. Mercenaries can be hired at a some space ports. Just examine the System Info or Personnel Roster to see if anyone is available. When you hire a mercenary, you have to pay him or her a certain amount of credits daily. You have to cough these up right before you warp otherwise the mercenary simply won't travel with you, but instead return to his or her home system.

•Pilot
The pilot skill determines how well you pilot your ship. A high piloting skill will enable you to flee from attacks easily, dodge attacks and to stay on the tail of fleeing ships if you want to keep attacking them. This makes the piloting skill important to traders, transporters and pirates. A navigating system will enhance your piloting capabilities.

•Fighter
The fighter skill determines how well you handle your weapons, in particular, how easy it is for you hit another ship. A trader who isn't interested in a pirating or bounty hunting career hasn't that much use of this skill, but for a pirate it is an absolute must. A targeting system will enhance your fighting capabilities.

•Trader
The trader skill determines what prices you must pay for trade goods, ships and equipment. A good trader can reduce prices up to 10%. This makes a high trader skill invaluable for traders, while pirates have less use for it. In the early stages of your life as a trader you might have a hard time getting any money if you work with low trading capabilities.

•Engineer
The engineer skill determines how well you keep your ship in shape. A good engineer may keep your hull and shields intact during a fight, will repair them quicker while traveling, and may even enhance your weaponry a bit so it does more damage. This makes the engineer skill important for both traders and pirates. An auto-repair system will enhance the engineering capabilities.

<TextView android:text="encounter other ships in space. Depending on the type of encounter, several things can happen.

•Encounter with a Trader
When you encounter a trader, the trader will usually ignore you. Occasionally a trader will hail you to ask whether you want to trade some goods. The deal offered might be good, but the trader might try to rip you off. If you have a bad reputation, the trader might flee on sight. A trader will never initiate an attack, but may respond aggressively if you do. While fighting you have the option to continue attacking or to flee. If a trader finds the fight goes bad for him and he can't manage to flee from you, he will often surrender to you. If he surrenders, you may continue attacking but you should accept his offer because you can then plunder his cargo holds. If you don't have enough room to store all the nice goods you rob, you can jettison some of your own cargo in space. Beware however, that space littering is frowned upon by the police and such actions will go on your record if they are noticed.

•Encounter with a Pirate
A pirate will usually attack as soon as he sees you, unless your reputation is such that he is afraid of you, in which case he might flee. While fighting a pirate, you can attack him or try to flee. You can even surrender to him, but in that case he will plunder your cargo holds. If you think you are smart and have nothing in your holds, he will extort cash from you under the threat of blowing your ship up. Surrender is therefore a bad option, though it is better than fighting to the death. In rare cases a pirate might decide to surrender to you. Plundering his ship usually isn't as profitable as plundering a trader, because a pirate tends to travel with many empty holds to store the goods he intends to get by robbing traders.

•Encounter with the Police
As long as you are an honest trader, the police will usually ignore you. They may ask you to submit to an inspection of your cargo bays. As long as you are not carrying illegal goods (firearms or narcotics), you have nothing to worry about. They will search your holds, apologize and up the status on your police record, indicating that you are someone who doesn't need to be searched that often. However, if you are carrying illegal goods, you best not let them search you, because then they will impound the illegal goods and fine you. Instead of agreeing to an inspection, you can try to bribe them. Depending on the type of government of the system, this is either impossible (if they are incorruptible), or costs an amount of money depending on how easy police officers under such a government can be bribed. It is always a good idea to explore the option of bribery: you can decide not to bribe them when you see how much money they want, but you might get away cheap.

The other options you have are to flee, or to attack them, in which case they will certainly attack you. Both fleeing and attacking will seriously damage your standing with the police. When your police record indicates that you are a criminal, police ships won't ask for an inspection anymore, but will attack you on sight. If your reputation indicates that you are too dangerous an opponent for them, they also might flee immediately. When they consider you a really dangerous criminal, they will send more and better ships after you.

You can surrender to the police, as long as you are not considered a psychopath they rather take in dead. If you do, you will be taken to a court of law and tried. You will have to spend some time in prison and pay a fine. If you don't have the credits to settle your fine, the police will sell your ship and will pay the fine out of the profits. If they need to do that, they will usually supply you with a Nanite when you leave prison. To avoid you having to pay huge interests on a loan, if you have the credits, the police will usually also settle those debts from your cash. Also remember that you can't pay your mercenaries and insurance from your cell, so your hired hands will leave you and your insurance will be stopped.

•Destruction
When things come to a fight and no-one manages to escape and no-one surrenders, the fight will end in the destruction of one or both ships. If you get destroyed and you have no escape pod, you will perish with your ship. If you survive and your opponent gets killed if you are lucky, one of the cargo canisters from his ship will drift in your direction and you can pick it up.

All ships utilize the tried and true GSC Snowflake hyper drive. As a ships size increases, so do the number of hyper drives required to safely perform a hyper jump.
.Nanite
The Nanite is the cheapest ship type. It is small, has few cargo holds, a weak hull and no weapon, shield or gadget slots. It is capable, however of traveling 20 parsecs on its fuel tanks, allowing you to jump over great distances. When you have an escape pod and you need to use it; you can convert the pod (which is basically a Nanite without fuel tanks and cargo bays) into a Nanite in a few days time. This is very beneficial since the Nanite can be sold for a higher price than you needed to invest to build it and it will allow you to travel off a solar system where you have been dropped off, even if there are no ships there to purchase.

.Firefly
The Firefly is the type of ship you start out with. It is a suitable ship for a starting trader. You can carry one shield and one gadget and have 15 cargo holds available. The maximum range it can travel on one tank is 15 parsecs.

•Stinger
The Stinger is the poor trader's dream. It is fairly cheap, has no less than 20 cargo bays, one of each equipment type slot, and can travel up to 17 parsecs on a tank. This makes the Stinger an ideal ship for those budding traders interested in transporting passengers.

•Scorpion
Those who aspire quick money by pirating, can do no better than buying a Scorpion in the early stages of their career. It can travel up to 14 parsecs on a full tank, has a fairly strong hull, and can carry two weapons next to one shield and one gadget. Its cargo holds are equal to a Firefly.

•Firespark
The Firespark is the stronger big sister of the Firefly. It has the more cargo bays, stronger hull strength, can carry one extra shield and one extra gadget and best of all, has extra crew quarters available so you can take a mercenary with you. It can travel up to 15 parsecs on a full tank. The Firespark is highly regarded among successful traders.

•Ru'Transport
The Ru'Transport is essentially a freighter. It is a difficult ship to use safely since it has a somewhat weak hull, no weapons, two shield slots and one gadget slot. It has however, no less than 60 cargo bays, three crew quarters and can travel 13 parsecs on a full tank. For those who want to get rich by trading or ferrying passengers, a Ru'Transport might be an excellent choice, as long as you visit safe systems.

•Hornet
The Hornet in the hands of a pirate can make for a very bad day as it can be a dangerous opponent. With its fairly strong hull, three weapon slots, two shield slots, one gadget slot and two crew quarters, you better flee this ship when you are still flying a Firefly yourself. It has 20 cargo holds to fill with goods (illegal, stolen or otherwise). It can travel up to 15 parsecs on a full tank.

•Star Hopper
The Star Hopper is suitable for both pirating and honest trading. It has a whopping 40 cargo holds, two weapon and shield slots, three gadget slots and three crew quarters. It can travel up to 16 parsecs on one tank. It has garnered the best value award for the past six years by the Galactic Shipbuilders Quarterly.

•Prax-T
The Prax-T is the ultimate trading / passenger ship. It has a strong hull, three shield slots for ultimate protection, two gadget slots, three crew quarters and no less than 60 cargo holds. Its weaknesses are its single weapon slot and relatively short traveling distance of only 13 parsecs. However, for luxury and comfort, nothing can compare.

•Dreadnaught
The Dreadnaught is the ultimate ship (pirate or trader). It has a strong hull, three weapon slots, two shield slots, two gadget slots and three crew quarters. It can travel up to 15 parsecs on a full tank. If there is any weakness to it, it is probably its price. Its 35 cargo holds make it also a suitable ship for traders when they like to travel to dangerous systems.



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

•Pirate Upgrades
There are rumors of systems that have large numbers of pirates where one can upgrade their existing equipment. These pirate upgrades, which can be applied to your ships hull, shield and weapon offer a marked improvement from the as-purchased equipment. The downside is these upgrades cannot be transferred to a new ship and of course the risk getting to one of these pirate ridden worlds.

That way if you have to surrender to pirates, they will find at least something to steal and won't resort to extorting you. Besides, when one of the pirate ships in a system has robbed you, he will probably have sent the message to the other pirates in the system that you are picked clean, and in all likelihood the others will leave you alone after that.


•Special situations in a system, like war, a cold spell, or boredom, last a while. It may be worth your while to bring such a system the goods they require from neighboring systems, since you can sell them with great profit. The LEN (local electronic news, like the newspapers of old Earth) may give information on special situations on nearby systems and are usually worth the pittance it costs to purchase.


•When you find two systems close to each other which require goods which the other one produces cheaply, you might find it tempting to keep traveling between them. However, since it will take a while before the stock of a system is replenished, this usually works only for a few short days. After that, you'll need to look elsewhere.


•Be warned that when you become richer, you will attract stronger types of pirates. Also, when the police starts to consider you a real villain, they will send more and stronger ships after you.


•Sometimes you get an offer to go on a special assignment for someone. You should remember, that if this assignment would be easy, the person who offers it to you would probably do it himself. So don't be too eager to follow up on such an assignment, unless you are fairly sure that you can stand your ground when things get a bit troublesome.
